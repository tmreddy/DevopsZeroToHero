    <h1>Infrastructure as Code</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>AWS CLI</li>
      <li>AWS Cloud formation templates</li>
      <li>Ec2 instances</li>
      <li>S3</li>
      <li>RDS</li>
      <li>Shifted AWS to Azure</li>
      <li>Migrate AWS CFT 100 of templates</li>
      <li>Using Azure Remote manager</li>
      <li>Shifted from Azure to On-premises</li>
      <li>
        Again migrate 100 of scripts to heat template as we are using openstack
        to build Infrastructure on premises
      </li>
      <li>Now a days companies are working on hybrid cloud</li>
      <li>
        Part of Infrastructure is on AWS and some part of Infrastructure is on
        Azure
      </li>
      <li>
        Now we have to learn AWS CFT and Azure Resourse manager to automate
        Infrastructure as code
      </li>
      <li>To solve this we can use Terraform</li>
      <li>Terrafom uses API as code</li>
      <li>Terraform is developed by Hashicorp</li>
      <li>Terraform will take care of creating Infrastructure</li>
      <li>For Terraform we need to give provider as AWS or Azure</li>
      <li>This concept is called API as code</li>
      <li>Terraform will talk to the AWS API, Azure API</li>
      <li>API is Application Interface</li>
      <li>CRUL</li>
      <li>Http request</li>
      <li><img src="/Images/Terraform.png" alt="Terraform" /></li>
      <li>Infrastructure as a code - Automate Infra</li>
      <li>API as code - Terraform use API as code</li>
